# 3D Isometric Editor

One day, I needed an isometric asset for a project.  
I found a tool on the web, created my asset… and when it was time to export, the PNG was **meeeehhhhh**.

So I decided to build my own tool:  
https://3d-isometric-editor.vercel.app/

I used it only once… to create **THE TRUCK 🛻**.
